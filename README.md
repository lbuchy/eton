# ETON

## Examples

		eton -h

    # quick add
		eton new '[ ] do something'

    # add text from STDIN
		ps aux | eton new -

    # add a file
		eton addfile file.txt

    # unique aliases can be set and used instead of numeric ids
		etone alias 2 processes

    # list all items
		eton ls -Lall

    # filter items containing words "thing" AND "some"
		eton ls thing some

    # you can mark specific items
		etone mark processes 1

    # only list marked or aliased items (short mode)
		etone ls -s

    # open an item in less
		etone show processes

    # edit items
		etone edit {1..3}

    # alias matching is fuzzy
		etone cat prcs

    # pass items to xargs as filenames:
		etone ls something -l |xargs -i less {}
